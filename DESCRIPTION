Title: Analysis of Codon Data under Stationarity using a Bayesian
        Framework
Note: We should increase the major version number to 1 and use the git commit info as the dev number.
      Versioning should be Major.Minor.Patch for released versions
      Versioning should be Major.Minor.Patch.<git commit hash> for development versions
      This doesn't work Version: paste0("0.1.5.", system("git --git-dir "./RibModelFramework" log -n 1 --pretty=format:%h", intern = TRUE))
      Issue seems to be the use of non-numeric characters
      See https://stackoverflow.com/a/56220622/5322644 for a possible solution using numbers

Description: Is a collection of models to analyze genome scale codon
        data using a Bayesian framework. Provides visualization
        routines and checkpointing for model fittings. Currently
        published models to analyze gene data for selection on codon
        usage based on Ribosome Overhead Cost (ROC) are: ROC (Gilchrist
        et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/gbe/evv087>), and ROC with phi
        (Wallace & Drummond (2013) <doi:10.1093/molbev/mst051>). In
        addition 'AnaCoDa' contains three currently unpublished models.
        The FONSE (First order approximation On NonSense Error) model
        analyzes gene data for selection on codon usage against of
        nonsense error rates. The PA (PAusing time) and PANSE (PAusing
        time + NonSense Error) models use ribosome footprinting data to
        analyze estimate ribosome pausing times with and without
        nonsense error rate from ribosome footprinting data.
