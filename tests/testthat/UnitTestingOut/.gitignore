# Due to git's structure, empty directories are not allowed.
# Thus, this .gitignore's primary purpose is to cause this directory to be indexed in the repo
# to allow output files to be produced (without keeping the output files in the directory).
# This file will also list the output files that are expected to be produced (and ignore them).
# 
# The reason why this is needed is because the Travis server cannot write to non-existent files.
#
# Note that there is some redundancy in what is ignored compared to the overall package as
# a result.
